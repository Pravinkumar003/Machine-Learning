Mark Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project predicts final marks based on CIA (Continuous Internal Assessment) marks using a Linear Regression model. The Data Science Lifecycle was followed to ensure an efficient dataset and an accurate ML model.

Steps Involved:
Problem Understanding â€“ Predict final marks based on given CIA marks.
Data Collection & Preprocessing â€“ Used previous semester CIA and final marks, handled missing values (e.g., 'AB' replaced with 0).
Data Visualization & Insights â€“ Explored and cleaned data for better accuracy.
Model Training â€“ Built a Multivariate Linear Regression Model (y = mx + c) where CIA marks are independent variables, and the final mark is the dependent variable.
Model Deployment â€“ Used Pickle to save and reuse the trained model.
Prediction â€“ The trained model predicts final marks for new CIA inputs.
This project successfully predicts student final marks with high accuracy using Linear Regression. ðŸš€
